#Description of the application

I created an application for backend purposes with some HTML and CSS. I am using an API from openweather
which provides me the data about the weather in the city that you are searching for.
In addition, I used Google Cloud Platfrom and especially the Google App Engine to deploy the application on the web and 
not only locally.

It is a project with an educational scope.
